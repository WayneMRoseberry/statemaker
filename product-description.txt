Here's the product I want to build:
A tool that will generate possible states from a description of a
finite state machine. A finite state machine is built by a set of
rules that define transitions from one state to another.

State Definitions:
A state is defined by a set of variables set to specific values. A state also
may also be compared with another state to establish whether they are equivalent.
Two states are equivalent if they share all the same variables set to the same
values.

Rule Definitions:
A rule describes an action or event which will transform a given set of variables
in the given state to a new set of values, which will comprise a new state.
A rule may be queried by passing it a current state definition, to which
the rull will indicate whether it is available.

Rule Implementation:
Rules implement a rule interface. The interface exposes two functions:
 - boolean isAvailable(state) - returns true if the rule is available with the current state
 - state execute(state) - returns a new state derived from executing the given state

State Machine Definition:
A state machine has the following properties
- States - a dictionary of states in the machine where each entry is keyed with an ID
- StartingState - the ID of the first state in the machine
- Transitions - the paths through the machine indicated by a starting and ending
  state ID and the action that causes the transition. The action corresponds to the
  name of the rule that created the transition.

State machine builder:
Implements a machine builder interface. The builder implements the following
functions:
 - StateMachine build(state initialState, Rule[] rules, BuilderConfig configuration)
   Returns a StateMachine built starting from initialSate and applying the rules specified
   the array rules. The configuration specifies behavior settings for the build
   method.

The interfaces for Rule, StateMachineBuilder, as well as the classes State and
BuilderConfig go in the statemaker assembly namespace. The namespace is imported
to allow building of custom rules.

Declarative State Machine Building:
It is possible to declare state machines without writing custom rules. There
will be a set of rules implemented that allow someone to define simple rules by
supplying the following information:
- rule name
- boolean expressions of state variable conditions that make the rule available
- transformation of which variables from original value to new value
There should be an API to call to define rules in this fashion. It should also
be possible to load a definition file describing declarative state machine
building.
