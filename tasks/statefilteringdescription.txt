State filtering, selection and attribution.

We want to be able to highlight states in a state machine definition which
certain criteria and then use to for selection, filtering, marking up with special
attributes and definition path traversal selection.

- A rules based mechanism for selecting nodes inside a state machine. Uses
similar rule expression mechanism as machine building, but rather than
driving the creation of a state machine, selects or filters items from an
already built state machine that match the criteria.

- A markup mechanism that adds attributes to state machine nodes as indicated
by the filtering rules. These attributes could be anything the filter
indicates, for example "ranking":"low". The attributes would be a different
set of properties on the state machine node than the state machine variables.

- The ability to export state machines definitions that only include
traversals that lead to one of the filtered nodes. This allows scenarios such
as:

Picking High Value Usage Paths
A business analyst wants to know which sequence of actions lead to high
priority features. They build a criteria for what the high priority features
are, load a built state machine definition, and export it to a new state
machine definition that now has all the ways through the machine that lead
to the high priority features.
